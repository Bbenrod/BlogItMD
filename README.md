BlogItMD is a minimalist CMS to easily publish blogs. The idea is that anyone can clone this project and start creating and viewing posts from the `/blog/upload` route (configurable).

## ▶️ Running the Project

- Run in production mode:

```bash
npm start
```

- Run in development mode (with nodemon for auto reload):

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## ✨ Main Features

- View posts at `/blog` (or the route set by `BLOG_ROUTE`).
- Upload new posts at `/blog/upload`.
- Example posts generated by the script `scripts/generatePosts.js` (creates 10 sample blogs).

---

## 🔐 Security and Sessions

Currently, the project uses `express-session` with in-memory storage (`MemoryStore`), suitable only for development and testing.

**For production, it is recommended to:**

- Use an external store like Redis (`connect-redis`), Mongo (`connect-mongo`), or others.
- Enable the `secure: true` option in sessions and use HTTPS.
- Set a strong and secret `SESSION_SECRET` in your `.env`.

Check the [official express-session documentation](https://github.com/expressjs/session) for more info.

---

## 📖 Usage Example

1. Clone the repository and run `npm install`.
2. Configure a `.env` file with your desired variables, for example:

```
PORT=3000
BLOG_ROUTE=/blog
SESSION_SECRET=my-super-secure-secret
```

3. Run `npm start` and open your browser at `http://localhost:3000/blog`.
4. Upload new posts at `http://localhost:3000/blog/upload`.
5. View your published posts at the base route.
